# Machine Learning Projects

This repo is where I collect all my small machine learning projects and assignments I worked on while learning about different algorithms. Itâ€™s a mix of code I wrote to practice and understand concepts better.

Not every project in those uploaded to this repo is 100% accurate (training/test data wasn't really selectively selected, also the assignments might sometimes have expected a bit varying alghoritms etc.)

# Projects Overview

1. Language Detection with Multi-class/layer Perceptron (language_detection)

> A multi-class/layer perceptron model that tries to detect the language of a given text using letter frequency features.

5. Perceptron (perceptron)

> Simple, single perceptron implementation

3. KMeans Clustering (alghoritm_kmeans)

> My implementation of the KMeans algorithm for clustering data into groups.

4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (alghoritm_knn)

> Basic KNN algorithm for classifying data points based on their nearest neighbors.

5. Precision, Recall, F1-score Evaluation (precision_recall_f1)

> A small project for calculating evaluation metrics to measure classification performance.
> We use f-score, recall, precision.


6. Decision Trees (decision_trees)

> A work-in-progress, to be honest, not really finished.
